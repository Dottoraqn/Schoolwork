				<div class="descText">This project was for my web design class. The assignment was to create a javascript page that allowed the user to change the css of the page around by interacting with the page. The unhosted php version can be also found on my <a href="https://github.com/Dottoraqn/Schoolwork/tree/master/proj4">github.</a></div>

				<div class="descText">This project required that we make a webpage with five different layouts to showcase the design principals that we learned in the first weeks of class.</div>

				<div class="titleText"><a href="https://github.com/Dottoraqn/Schoolwork/tree/master/project6">Weather and News Dashboard App</a></div>
				<div class="descText">For this assignment, we were required to have a dropdown menu of five to seven cties. Selecting one would show the weather in that city, a background image of that city, and the news, or some other tidbit of information.<br>With my professor's approval, I decided to complicate the project and instead of a dropdown menu, I challanged myself and implemented a searchbar. We were required to use three APIs for the project. One of the APIs I used was the Flickr API, which is subject to massive changes on a regular basis. Thus, background images may or may not work.</div>

				<div class="descText">For our first game assignment for Media Device Architecture (commonly known as "the gameboy class"), the objective was to create a game with a win-state, a lose-state, and to have working gameplay.</div>
