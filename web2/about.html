					I am a third year student at Georgia Tech. For all of my time at the college, I've loved my major, Computational Media. Computational Media is a mashup of Computer Science and Art. A student of Computational Media may work in fields like graphic, web, or UI design or video or game production.
					<div class="sp">i</div>
					After I graduate in May of 2016, I'm looking forward to working in one of the above fields. My passion is video production, but I've also had a large interest in drawing and writing code for websites since high school.
					<div class="sp">i</div>
					I'm an avid cosplayer, gamer, and reader. Cosplay is the art of making or purchasing the costumes of popular characters and wearing them to conventions around the world. In the process of sewing costumes and constructing props, I've started my own buisness making costume comissions for other people.
					<div class="sp">i</div>
					As I'm nearing the end of my time at Georgia Tech and more and more of my friends are graduating, I've enjoyed talking with friends all around the nation about the jobs that they've had and currently hold. I'm excited for what my future in the industry holds.
